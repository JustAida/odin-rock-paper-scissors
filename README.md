# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This project is a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
This project will demonstrate what I have learned:
1. How to assign variables.
2. How to declare functions.
3. How to invoke the functions.
4. How to ask user for the input.
5. How to use conditional statements [if, else if, else].

Note: This project can only see the result in the console as of now.
